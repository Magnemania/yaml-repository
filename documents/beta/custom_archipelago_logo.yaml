# This is an example showing how to use Custom Mission Orders to make a pixel-art Archipelago logo.
# As with all custom mission orders, this requires setting "mission_order: custom" in your YAML to work.
# Colours come from mapping different cells to different races; hence, it requires all races to be enabled.
# To have enough missions of each faction, it's also necessary to have race-swaps enabled.

# Mission unlocks follow a grid pattern, with the ability to jump over gaps in orthogonal directions up to 3 slots away.

# Contains:
# terran missions: 34
# protoss missions: 30
# zerg missions: 34
