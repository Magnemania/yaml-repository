# yaml-repository
A repository of Starcraft 2 settings yamls for Archipelago

## Navigating this repository
This repository is split up in complete yaml documents and yaml triggers that act as modifiers. Triggers may be applied to complete yamls to provide extra challenges or theming, such as restricting the item pool or the mission pool.

## Rules for submissions
1. Yamls should be valid; they should have valid yaml syntax and have generated with at least one version of Archipelago Starcraft 2
2. Yamls should properly credit the author(s)
3. Yamls should include a comment or description to indicate what version of the generator they work with. If they are written for a beta or in-development version, they should indicate version by stating git repository, branch, and a date (a precise commit would be appreciated but is not necessary).
4. Trigger files should describe the modifier near the top of the file in a comment
